***Low Level Language:***
Low-level languages ​​can be converted to machine code without a compiler or interpreter (second-generation programming languages ​​use a simpler processor called an assembler), and the resulting code is executed directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small portion of memory, which helps optimization, however, low-level languages ​​**are more complicated to understand because of their syntax.

***High Level Language:***
A High Level Language consists of a set of symbols and letters and requires translation into machine language. Both machine code and assembly languages ​​are hardware specific. A high-level language is a programming language that uses **English and mathematical symbols in its instructions, and is much simpler in syntax so they are easier to understand.
